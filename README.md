# Bookmarklets

Repository of personal bookmarklets, tested on Firefox.

How to use: for each bookmarklet, paste their code into a browser bookmark. Click the bookmark to run them.

Note: do not use `// inline comments` and add semicolons to the end of every line, because they are evaluated as a single line.

[Use bookmarklets to quickly perform common web page tasks](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/bookmarklets-perform-common-web-page-tasks)
